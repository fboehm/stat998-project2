\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death in the United
States and much of North America and Europe. In 2011, one American died
of CAD every 40 seconds, on average, and 155,000 of those deaths were
people aged less than 65 years.\footnote{Mozaffarian et al., ``Executive
  Summary.'' } One manifestation of CAD is a myocardial infarction (MI),
which is also called a ``heart attack''. A MI results from a clot in a
coronary artery that diminishes blood flow to the heart muscle, or
myocardium. If blood flow disruption persists for a sufficiently long
time, the muscle may die, or infarct. The irreparable dead heart muscle
diminishes the overall ability of the heart to pump blood. Severe MIs
may lead to a patient's death.

Epidemiologists have identified modifiable and non-modifiable risk
factors that contribute to CAD risk. Smoking is among the strongest
modifiable risk factors, and is thought to elevate CAD risk by
triggering elevations in inflammatory molecules in the bloodstream.
\_\_\_\_
\todo[inline, color = red]{What is mechanism for smoking causing CAD?}.
Diabetes mellitus and hypertension (systolic or diastolic) are typically
considered non-modifiable risk factors, although their contribution to
CAD risk may be reduced in patients who undertake dramatic lifestyle
interventions, such as exercise programs and diet with weight loss.
Non-modifiable risk factors include age, a family history of CAD and
presence of certain genetic variants
\todo[inline, color = pink]{what are other known risk factors?}.

Our collaborators at the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) have
undertaken an investigation on a subset of WLS participants with the
goal of identifying CAD risk factors in the WLS study population. The
ultimate goal of this project is to develop an intervention program to
reduce CAD morbidity and mortality in Wisconsin. The investigators would
like to extend such an intervention program to Wisconsin residents who
are not WLS subjects. Our goal in this report is to identify risk
factors for MI among WLS participants.

\subsection{Study design}\label{study-design}

The Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) is a long-term study of a random
sample of 10,317 men and women who graduated from Wisconsin high schools
in 1957. According to the WLS website ``WLS provides an opportunity to
study the life course, intergenerational transfers and relationships,
family functioning, physical and mental health and well-being, and
morbidity and mortality from late adolescence through 2011.''\footnote{``Wisconsin
  Longitudinal Study''. }

\todo[inline, color = blue]{need more info on WLS?}

Our collaborators collected data from the original respondents or their
parents in 1957, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2004, and 2011; from a selected
sibling in 1977, 1994, 2005, and 2011; from the spouse of the original
respondent in 2004; from the spouse of the selected sibling in 2006; and
from widow(er)s of the graduates and siblings in 2006.

\subsection{Data description}\label{data-description}

Our collaborators shared with us a data set that contains records for
19095 individuals (including original subjects and siblings) with 310
variables per subject. 9363 subjects responded (with yes or no) to the
2011 question of whether they had ever had a heart attack.

\subsection{Exploratory data analyses}\label{exploratory-data-analyses}

Since our WLS data included 310 variables, we won't provide summaries
for all of them in this document. Instead, we focus our exploratory
analyses on our response variables (HAC2011, HAC2004, HACinc, doc2011,
doc2004, docinc) and covariates that other researchers have identified
as associated with coronary artery disease.

Age is known, from epidemiologic studies, to be a strong risk factor for
CAD, with older individuals having an elevated CAD risk.

\todo[inline, color = green]{what to explore for categorical data? Only the proportion in each category????}

\subsection{Statistical modeling}\label{statistical-modeling}

We used statistical modeling to try to identify covariates that
associated with six distinct outcomes: 1) HAC2004, 2) HAC2011, 3)
DOC2004, 4) DOC2011, 5) new self-reported heart attacks (from 2004 to
2011) and 6) new heart attack per doctor's report (from 2004 to 2011).
For a subject to qualify as a ``new'' self-reported heart attack, they
must have responded ``No'' in 2004 and ``Yes'' in 2011. Analogous
definition applies for ``new'' doctor-reported heart attack.

We found that HAC2004 had 11534 non-missing responders (with 665
responding ``Yes'' and 10869 responding ``No''). Counts for other
variables are provided in Appendix A.

\subsubsection{Statistical modeling with Framingham study
predictors}\label{statistical-modeling-with-framingham-study-predictors}

We identified those variables in the WLS that closely match those in the
Framingham study\footnote{D'Agostino et al., ``General Cardiovascular
  Risk Profile for Use in Primary Care the Framingham Heart Study.'' } (
Table \ref{tab:fram2wls}). It's important to note that the Framingham
study used survival analysis methods, including Cox proportional hazards
regression, to identify risk factors for a cardiovascular event. Thus,
their study design, analysis, and purpose differ from ours.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r}\label{tab:fram2wls}
Framingham study variable & WLS Variable\\
\hline
Sex & Sex\\
Quantitative total cholesterol & highchol2011 or highchol2004\\
Quantitative HDL cholesterol & None\\
Smoking & Columns 61 to 87 aim to quantify smoking \\
Diabetes & diabetes2004, diabetes2011, diabdiag2004, diabdiag2011\\
Age & Age\\
Systolic BP & highbp2004, highbp2011* \\
Treated for high blood pressure & None\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Framingham study variables and their closest analogs in WLS. (* SBP not available, so we used reported "high BP".)}
\end{table}

Because the risk factors from the Framingham study have strong effect
sizes, are easily interpreted, and widely used by both physicians and
public health scientists, we decided to perform logistic regression
analyses with solely those WLS variables that most closely matched the
Framingham variables. We analyzed each of the 6 outcomes of interest.
For each outcome variable, we fitted a logistic regression model using
the entire data set (omitting those subjects with missing data). We then
transformed the fitted logit values to probabilities before plotting a
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each model, in which
we use the fitted probabilities to examine the trade-off between
specificity and sensitivity. We also calculated the area under the curve
(AUC) for each ROC curve.\footnote{Robin et al., ``PROC.'' }

\subsection{Future directions}\label{future-directions}

Given the relatively low cost of acquiring genomics data, one possible
future direction is to acquire genomics data for a subset of study
subjects. For example, SNP genotype data from each subject may enable us
to further discriminate those subjects that are at high risk for a CAD
event. Such knowledge may be translated into the proposed intervention
program, for example, by promoting healthy diet and physical activity
among those at greatest risk.
