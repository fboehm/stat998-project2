\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death in the United
States and much of North America and Europe. More than \_\_\_
\todo[inline]{find a number!} Americans died in 2013 from CAD. One
manifestation of CAD is a myocardial infarction (MI), which is also
called a ``heart attack''. A MI results from a clot in a coronary artery
that diminishes blood flow to the heart muscle, or myocardium. If blood
flow disruption persists for a sufficiently long time, the muscle may
die, or infarct. The irreparable dead heart muscle diminishes the
overall ability of the heart to pump blood. Severe MIs may lead to a
patient's death.

Epidemiologists have identified modifiable and non-modifiable risk
factors that contribute to CAD risk. Smoking is among the strongest
modifiable risk factors, and is thought to elevate CAD risk by \_\_\_\_
\todo[inline, color = red]{What is mechanism for smoking causing CAD?}.
Diabetes mellitus, hypertension (systolic or diastolic) are typically
considered non-modifiable risk factors, although their contribution to
CAD risk may be reduced in patients who undertake dramatic lifestyle
interventions, such as exercise programs and diet with weight loss.
Additional risk factors include
\todo[inline, color = pink]{what are other known risk factors?}

Our collaborators at the Wisconsin Longitudinal Survey (WLS) have
undertaken a study on a subset of WLS participants with the goal of
identifying CAD risk factors in the WLS study population. The ultimate
goal of this project is to develop an intervention program to reduce CAD
morbidity and mortality in Wisconsin. The investigators would like to
extend such an intervention program to Wisconsin residents who are not
WLS subjects. Our goal in this report is to identify risk factors for MI
among WLS participants.

\subsection{Study design}\label{study-design}

The Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) is a long-term study of a random
sample of 10,317 men and women who graduated from Wisconsin high schools
in 1957. According to the WLS website ``WLS provides an opportunity to
study the life course, intergenerational transfers and relationships,
family functioning, physical and mental health and well-being, and
morbidity and mortality from late adolescence through
2011.''(``Wisconsin Longitudinal Survey'' 2015)

\todo[inline, color = blue]{need more info on WLS}

Our collaborators collected data from the original respondents or their
parents in 1957, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2004, and 2011; from a selected
sibling in 1977, 1994, 2005, and 2011; from the spouse of the original
respondent in 2004; from the spouse of the selected sibling in 2006; and
from widow(er)s of the graduates and siblings in 2006.
